# Impactful
Currently, fragmented and outdated software are making it extremely difficult for non-profits to quantify their impact and automate their workflow. On average, employees at non-profits are spending 30% of their time, worth on average $13k per person per year, doing tasks that could be automated or avoided all together.

Impactful's platform introduces a bottom-up, automated approach to managing programs, which helps stakeholders understand the impact that the organization is having on their mission, in real-time.
